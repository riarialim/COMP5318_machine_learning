# COMP5318 Machine Learning and Data Mining
It was one of the core units of the Master of Complex Systems at the University of Sydney. I did it in 2020.
This repository showcases the code my teammates and I developed for the assignments.

## Assignment 1
* Individual project
* Little classification exercise using the Fashion MNST dataset
* Methods used:
  * K-Nearest Neighbours
  * Naive Bayes
 

## Assignment 2
* Group project, collaborated with [Julio](https://github.com/julio-correa-rios) and [Will](https://github.com/w-v-r)
* Another classification project but this time using the CIFAR-100 dataset
* Methods used:
  * Gaussian Naive Bayes
  * Random Forest
  * Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
